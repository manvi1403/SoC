#SoC Midterm
I explored the Pandas library in Python and learned how to modify and edit CSV files using various commands. I also gained an understanding of key concepts such as cosine similarity, cosine distance, TF-IDF vectorizer, and count vectorizer.

Additionally, I learned how to merge, join, and concatenate multiple files, which was especially useful in Week 2 when I needed to combine different datasets containing distinct information about movies with the same ID. This helped in consolidating all relevant details of a particular movie into a single file.

In Weeks 3 and 4, we were provided with code by the mentor, which we had to understand thoroughly. We were also given helpful YouTube resources to support our learning and project development.
